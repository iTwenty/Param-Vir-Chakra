    <string name="str_about_details">The Param Vir Chakra (PVC) is India\'s highest military decoration awarded for the
        highest degree of valour or self-sacrifice in the presence of the enemy. It can be, and often has been, awarded
        posthumously.\n
        The award also carries a cash allowance for those under the rank of lieutenant (or the appropriate service
        equivalent) and, in some cases, a cash award. By March 1999, the stipend stood at Rs. 1500 per month. In
        addition, many states have established individual pension rewards that far exceeds the central government\'s
        stipend for the recipients of the decoration.\n
